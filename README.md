# Detectron2 implementation of DA-Faster-RCNN

This is the implementation of CVPR 2018 work 'Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN for Object Detection in the Wild'. The aim is to improve the cross-domain robustness of object detection, in the screnario where training and test data are drawn from different distributions. The original paper can be found [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Chen_Domain_Adaptive_Faster_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)
